                                    Covid-19 spreads primarily through the air. Studies have shown that the virus can remain
                                    infectious in airborne particles for more than three hours. What's less certain is the degree to
                                    which it can spread via surfaces such as banknotes and touchscreens.

                                    Previous studies have assessed its survivability on stainless steel and their results have
                                    varied wildly, ranging from between three and 14 days at room temperature. The new study looked
                                    at how long the virus could survive on glass, paper and plastic notes as well as steel. They
                                    found that they could detect it after 28 days on all these surfaces at 20C - significantly
                                    longer than the earlier studies had indicated.

                                    The experiments were, however, carried out in virus friendly conditions - in a dark room with
                                    stable temperatures and humidity - so the virus may well not do so well in the real world.
